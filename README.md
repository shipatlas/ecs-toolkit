# ECS Toolkit

ECS Toolkit is a convenience tool that aims to make it easier to manage an
application already running on ECS where an application is a group of different ECS services and tasks.

## Introduction

### Use Cases

For example, you can use it within your CI/CD pipeline to rollout new changes to
your running services or even run new tasks with those new changes. While
managing deployments is an obvious use case, the intention is that it will grow
to have more functionality where it makes sense to.

If there's a use-case that you would like considered, [please file an
issue][new-issue] with your request.

### Motivation

Simply put, a lot of the existing tooling doesn't do a good job simplifying the
update process. You kinda have to jump through hoops to make it work.

For example, when updating application configuration on ECS, at some point
you'll need to update the task definition before updating the service or running
a new task. Doing so in most cases involves using the [AWS CLI][aws-cli] to
register a new task definition.

Unfortunately using `register-task-definition` requires the task definition
passed in as JSON. You can get that from `describe-task-definition` but it's not
easy use that output as input for `register-task-definition` without hitting
issues such as [this][why-problem-1], [this][why-problem-2] and
[this][why-problem-3].

And granted, there are other official projects such as [ECS CLI][aws-ecs-cli]
and [Fargate CLI][aws-fargate-cli] that try to provide alternative ways of
managing ECS deployments but they both felt unsatisfactory. Presenting another
take at solving the same problem felt like the natural and best way forward.

### Features

Takes inputs as a config file which allows you to:

* Define all the services and tasks that make up an application in a concise
  configuration file that's easy to grok at a glance i.e. `.ecs-toolkit.yml`,
  you could think of this as an `application.yml` file.
* Define all the important configuration options for tasks and services that are
  most applicable for deployments.

As part of the deployment process, it:

* Registers a new task definition with a new image.
* Runs new tasks and update services with the new task definition.
* Runs the tasks and services asynchronously for faster deployments.
* Watches a service until it's stable or a task until it's stopped.
* Provides extensive logging and sufficient reporting throughout the process to
  catch failures and monitor progress.

It can also:

* Update the image of only select containers in the new task definition.
* Run pre-deployment tasks before updating services e.g. database migrations,
  asset syncing.
* Run post-deployment tasks after updating services e.g. cleanup.
* Optionally skip pre-deployment and post-deployment tasks during deployment.
* Perform redeploys using the same image with an option forcing a pull of the
  image.

## Configuration

### Application Config File

The application config file describes the tasks and services that make up an
application. For example, a config file for a typical Rails application that
consists of a CDN assets sync, database migration, web-server, background worker
and worker scheduler is shown below:

```yaml
---
version: v1
cluster: example
tasks:
  pre:
    - family: app-asset-sync
      count: 1
      containers:
        - rails
      launch_type: fargate
      network_configuration: 
        vpc_configuration:
          assign_public_ip: true
          security_groups:
            - sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
          subnets:
            - subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    - family: app-database-migrate
      count: 1
      containers:
        - rails
      launch_type: ec2
    # add as many tasks as needed
services:
  - name: app-web-server
    containers:
      - rails
  - name: app-worker
    containers:
      - resque
  - name: app-worker-scheduler
    containers:

### AWS Credentials

The AWS SDK used internally uses its default credential chain to find AWS
credentials. The SDK detects and uses the built-in providers automatically,
without requiring manual configuration. For example, if you use IAM roles for
Amazon EC2 instances, it automatically use the instanceâ€™s credentials.

### IAM Policy

Regardless of the credential setup, the owner of the credentials should have a
policy that assigns the required permissions, which are:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",
                "ecs:RunTask",
                "ecs:UpdateService"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "ecs:cluster": "arn:aws:ecs:${Region}:${Account}:cluster/${ClusterName}"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:ListTaskDefinitions",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

### Deploying

Taking the below definition of an Rails application with a database migration
and a web-server:

```yaml
---
version: v1
cluster: example
tasks:
  pre:
    - family: app-database-migrate
      count: 1
      containers:
        - rails
      launch_type: ec2
services:
  - name: app-web-server
    force: false
    containers:
      - rails
  ```

It is easy to deploy a new version of your application using the `deploy`
command:

```console

## Development

Below instructions are only necessary if you intend to work on the source code.
For normal usage the above instructions should do.

### Requirements

1. Ensure that you have a [properly configured][golang-quickstart] Go workspace.

### Building

1. Clone the repository.
2. Fetch the dependencies with `go get -v github.com/shipatlas/ecs-toolkit`.
4. Install application dependencies via `make dependencies` (they'll be placed
   in `./vendor`).
5. Build and install the binary with `make build`.
6. Run the command e.g. `./bin/ecs-toolkit help` as a basic test.

### Testing

1. Install the `golangci-lint`, [see instructions here][golangci-lint-install].
